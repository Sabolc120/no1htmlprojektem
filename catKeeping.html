        Cat keeping is a little complicated. There are a lot factor that depending on, that what type the cats are.<br>
        I will try to talk about as much things as i can, But i cant write about everything. I'm going to write about:
        Feeding, comfort, care.
        <hr>
        <h2 class="középre">Feeding</h2>     
        From my own experience, daily three times you give food, but sadly i can't say any precize amount as its depending on the cat type.<br>
        However you must don't give them more food than daily three, and its important too, to don't feel bad because that 2,5$ to buy the better cat food.<br>
        Because, on nutrient, can your cat fur, health, and mood depending too. <br>
        You can give them home food too, but there are some foods that are forbidden.
        <ul id="etel_sorolas">
            <img src="./images/macska_etetés.png" class="cica_kepek" id="elhelyezes">
            <li>1. Milk: can lead to Diarrhea, they only can get a very little amount.</li>
            <li>2. Raw egg, can lead to infections </li>
            <li>3. Liver, no problem from normal amount, in big amount it can risk infections.</li>
            <li>4. Onions, even in little amount its dangerous for cats, leads to anemia.</li>
            <li>5. Mushrooms, its can lead to death too.</li>
            <li>6. Alcohol, can lead to a coma or even death</li>
            <li>7. Tuna, can lead to malnutrition</li>
            <li>8. Grapes and Rasins, can lead to renal impairment.</li>
            <li>9. Coffein, in big amount it can lead to death.</li>
            <li>10. Chocolate, sugars, chewing, heart rhytm disorder and leads to death too.</li>
            <li>11. Clipping and Bones,Fat can leads to digestive problems. The bones can lead to drowning</li>
        </ul>
        If its possible stay far from these type of foods if you want to give food for your cat.
        <h2 class="középre">Comfort</h2>
        <img src="./images/macska_alszik.png" class="cica_kepek">
        The cats can be complicated sometimes. You can buy them a 100$ cat furniture, they are not going to use it. They will only use the very first one, especially if its a bed.  Be careful with this.<br> The smell and the habit, they will go to that place where they first falled asleep. Its can be a basket with a pillow inside it or anyhting else.<br>
        From that moment, its going to be the most comforted place for them, that gives safety. Every cat has their own weird things in this topic<br>
        Our cat when he get scared, then he will hide inside a basket and sleeping there too. that is his "calm" place its important to respect it.<br>
        There are exceptions when they move to another bed, in the exceptions when the last one is broken.
        <h2 class="középre">Care</h2>
        <img src="./images/hosszuszoru_macska.png" class="cica_kepek">
        This is stricly depending on the cat type, i'm going to write about more things.<br>
        You stricly need to comb a long-hair cat regularly, because if you skip this there will be cat hair everywhere!<br>
        <ul id="ápolás_felsorolás">
            <li>All over the room</li>
            <li>Clothes on the ground</li>
            <li>The bed where they usually cleain theirselfs</li>
            <li>Even the foods, or all over the kitchen.</li>
        </ul>
        And this is why combing is important. Suggestion: If a shirt or any other cloth becomes so terribly cat-haired that you cant wear it, you can save it by watering your hand and rub off the cat hair from it.
        If we skip the combing, then we need to live along with the above things. And never bath them! They hate it, they know how to clean theirselfs.
