        There are two types of human. Cat enjoyers, and dog enjoyers. This webpage is rather for the cat enjoyers.<br>
        I'm personally a cat enjoyer, the dogs are more annoying in my opinion, and I rather keep a cat next to me than a dog.<br>
        For the next reasons:
        <o>
            <pre><li>You can pet them anytime</li><b>If they are tolerate it...</b></pre>
            <pre><li>They calm you</li><b>If its at night you will need earplugs..</b></pre>
            <pre><li>You don't need to take them outside like you do with a dog.</li><b>Instead of this, clean their places. Inside your stinky house...</b></pre>
            <pre><li>They are usually very calm, and do not annoy you.</li><b>Except if they are playing, everything is going to break..</b></pre>
        </o>
        The cats has good and bad traits too, however you need to compromise next to a cat, and next to a dog too. Its more about,<br>
        which one are you able to bear, and live next to it.
        There are a lot stray cat and dog outside, and all of them are searching a new owner in this moment too. This is really sad, If i don't like cats then I would just choose a dog if I could afford it..'hint'hint'<br>
        The cats are sadly very noisy at the nights, and if we leave open our room door they sometimes even go crazy and running up and down, while we cant even decide that they are meowing, or MAOO-ing
        Many people say about cats, that they are lonely creatures. However, nobody would want to live 12 years inside house alone,<br> now lets see the things from the cat perspective. Because, if they have another cat next to them they will surely feel better.. at the beginning there will be surely fights for the area's, however 1 week later you wont even be able to recognize them as they will became so close to each other.<br> <img src="./images/cat_hug.png" alt="cat_hug" id="cat_hug">
        &#8592; Like this. The cat is not a lonely creature, they need a friend, from the same species in my opinion.<br>
        If you bring home a younger boy kitty to your older female cat, then there is even a chance that the female cat will accept him as her son. This situation has happened with us, we didn't even know that what happened. 3 days ago they was fightning in every hour then later they started to sleep next to each other and even clean each other.<br>
        The cats can be very suprising, I would even call them a mystery.<br>
        When they are mewoing, then they get their food but still leave it there<br>
        When they rub onto items, they are doing it with such an enjoy.<br>
        When they bite you while you pet them..<br>
        When they flatten before you can pet them..<br>
        When its like they are want to tell you something with their ears..<br>
        I will explain everything in this webpage about these things.
