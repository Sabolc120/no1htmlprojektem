        <h2 class="középre">Ear moving</h2>
        <img src="./images/cica_ful.png" class="cica_kepek">
        When they are looking at each other or at their owner, you can recognize weird ear movings.<br>
        This only has one role: The communication between cats, no, they are not communicating with meow.<br>
        The meowing is only for communication with humans, but there are exceptions.<br>
        However, who already has a cat this is not a new fact.<br>
        Every ear moving direction has it own role.
        <h2 class="középre">Why evading your hand during pet?</h2>
        <img src="./images/macska_jatszik.png" class="cica_kepek">
        The cats are usually in good mood and they rubbing onto everything. But there are exceptions when the opposite happens and they decline you to pet them.<br>
        When this happens before you can pet them, they go to flatten so you can't reach them. The cat owners are sure already experienced this.<br>
        When this happens, this means they doesn't want you to pet them and they want you to leave them alone.<br>
        There are moments when even our cats are not full with joy, or they just finished with their fur cleaning and doesn't want to get dirty by human hands.
        <h2 class="középre">The cat bites you while you pet them.</h2>
        The cats cannot express their feelings..they can't talk and then communicating with meowing is not possible. I mean, can you understand it? There are two types of cat bites. Aggressive, and lovely. It sounds weird, but cats bite you when they just want to express their liking.<br>
        These bites are very weak, if you recognize that they bite you while you pet them but its not hurts, then you don't need to worry.<br>
        Because: They just express their love.
        <h2 class="középre">I give food, but they just leaving it there!</h2>
        <img src="./images/cat_cute.png" class="cica_kepek">
        Cats..cats..they are doing even the weirdest things, and this one belongs here too.<br>
        Because, they keep meowing till you give them food but then they leaving it there.<br>
        In fact, your cat is not hungry they simply just want to test you that how much do you care about them. <br>
        If you gave food to them then they will rub onto you and then thank.<br>
        Do you remember when the cat hunt down something then brings it to you?<br>
        This is almost the same!
        The difference is, that they now want something from you and if they won't get it they become grumpy<br>
        After you gave it to them, they look at you with closed eyes which in short means smiling.
