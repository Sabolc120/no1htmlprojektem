        There are so many cat types. Breeders decades of work, or they travelled to countries, so they can save some species.<br>
        There are very interesting stories about these, we are not going to go very deep into them.<br>
        However I choose 3 types, and I will try to write as much as I can about them!

        <h3>Birman</h3>
        The story took place in a temple called Lau-Tsun in Asia. Mun-Ha is one of the priests of the temple, often knelt front of a goddess statue, with his white cat. Which was called Shinh<br>
        Because an accident the priest was dying, but when Shinh touched him with its paw and turned onto the statue its body turned into gold color, where its owner touched it, its stayed white.<br>
        They say that the white is the symbol of pureness, all of the cats around the temple turned into the same.<br>
        After two human helped on the temple, the priests gave them a present which was a Birman pair.<br>
        The species origin is unknown, and text above is just a story. there can be genetic sickness both original and from mixed types too.<br>

        <h3>Burmilla</h3>
        The burmilla is a result of an accident, due to the occurrence of an unplanned thing. 
        Its very surprising that from what species the Burmilla was created: Chinchilla, Persian cat, purple burmai paired<br>
        four kitties born, they were little and short, they had dense and unusual coloured fur.<br>
        However the breeders liked their beautifullnes and that they can breed new species from the kitties.
        Even today, they are very rare. In Britain they are still just experimenting with their breeding, and in USA there are no species.<br>
        This cat is a basket with full of love, quiet, and calmed, extroverted.<br>
        Very playful even after growned up, really loves its family, but not really need the attention.<br>
        Short and smooth fur, easy care, the head is moderately round, The eyes can pick up any type shades of green.

        <h3>Egyptian Mau</h3>
        These cats was sitting next to the pharaoh's, which could be true. the Egyptians loved cats, there were a lot cat on portraits, they was usually tabby cats. <br>
        With the knowledge we own at the moment, an Russian princess called Natalie Trubetsky got it as a gift,while she was living in Rome. Trubetskoy wanted to keep this cat specy, so she decided to breed them.
        Their voice is a clicking sound, while they usually knead, they are doing this when they are happy. their tie with the family is very strong, and they love playing.<br>
        If they are not doing anything at the moment, then they just sit next to their owner or sit on its owner lap just like their ancestors.<br>
        they need weekly one combing, their fur base can be silver,bronze,smokycolor, they has big green eyes too.
        <ul>
            <li>Very strong tie with the family, playful, friendly.</li>
        </ul>
